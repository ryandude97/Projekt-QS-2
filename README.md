# Project 2: Website with a Search Engine

## **Name: Ryan Stroemel

## Abstract:  
The purpose of this project is to create a website with a search engine that can loop through GIPHY's API and display image results on the page. 


## Workflow Requirements

### User Stories:

**1.** "I am looking to display a data array of gifs using jquery and bootstraps' APIs for a web development project."
*- Pablo*

**2.** "I need gifs for my journalism articles and a useful interface."  
*- Laura*

### Wireframes:

**1.** First, I created a basic layout of the web and mobile interface design on CodePen.  
*The CodePen Reference Page can be found [here](https://codepen.io/ryandude97/pen/zYpEwqO).*

### Development Phase:

**1.** Created GitHub Repository  [Projekt-QS-2](https://github.com/ryandude97/Projekt-QS-2).

**2.** Added [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com) to the project.

**3.** Obtained an API key through [Giphy Developers](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide) website.

**4.** Created a responsive website using [Bootstrap Grid System](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/), added a collapsible [Bootstrap Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) and [Bootstrap Input Group](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/input-group/). 

**5.** Added custom CSS and [Ruby SASS](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass), transpiled to SCSS, through a combination of the command line and configuring the Visual Studio Code extension [Live SASS Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass). Modified CSS to import [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

**6.** Added working JavaScript code by referencing class materials and code examples found on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

**7.** Modified JavaScript code to display search results to the webpage and worked on translating the working JavaScript to jQuery.

#### Future Improvements:

**1.** I would like to make the bootstrap wireframe to be more customized with more css code. 

**2.**  Bootstrap classes are the main classes on the page. I would like to expand the usage of standard css classes. 

**3.**   I want to be working on my JavaScript and jQuery skills for creating web apps.
